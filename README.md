# Excel Projects 

This repository consists of projects and analyzes in Excel.





## Excel Bike Project

The goal of this project was to improve my skills in organizing and manipulating data, performing calculations and analyses, and creating visual representations of data using graphs and charts. The final results of my work can be found in the "Excel Bike Dataset.xlsx" file in the "Dashboard" tab.

#### Data Cleaning 

I started by gathering a dataset related to bike sales from GitHub. I downloaded the dataset in its raw format. (The raw dataset is in the file "Excel Bike Dataset - Raw.xlsx").

- I started by cleaning up the data by identifying and removing any duplicate entries.

- To make the data more understandable and consistent, I replaced the abbreviations of the variable column names with their corresponding full forms.

- Furthermore, I have organized the age data into meaningful groups for easier visualization. I created a new column using Excel's IF function to divide people into age groups such as "Teen", "Middle Age", and "Old" based on their age values.

#### Data Procesing 

Once the data collection and cleaning phase was complete, I proceeded with data processing in Excel for my project.

- One of the key data processing steps I undertook was creating a pivot table. Using Excel's PivotTable feature, I was able to summarize and aggregate bicycle sales data based on various variables such as sales data, customer demographics, and product details. This enabled easier data analysis and visualization and valuable insights from the bicycle sales dataset. 

#### Insights 

The analysis in a dynamic way, depending on selected data filters such as region, marital status or education level, provides information on gender, age group of buyers and purpose of commuting. The final project is available in the "Excel Bike Dataset.xlsx" file.

## Excel Sales Project

In this project, I used Excel to create an interactive dashboard to obtain information about the company's sales.

#### Data Cleaning 

I downloaded the data from Kaggle ("Sales Data - Raw.xlsx") and started cleaning it.

- I started by removing empty lines from the data, changed data types and got rid of duplicates.

- I created new columns with data needed for further analysis.

#### Data Procesing 

Once I finished cleaning the data, I started processing the data in Excel for my project.

- I created new sheets with pivot tables needed to create a dashboard. Using Excel's PivotTable function, I was able to summarize and aggregate data on, among others, total sales, sales by state, monthly sales, and the number of customers and their purchase volume. This enabled easier analysis and visualization of data.

#### Insights

The analysis in a dynamic way, depending on the selected data filters, product category and year, provides information about the total sales and profit, the sales volume of individual product subcategories, the profit achieved over the years, the monthly sales volume, the number of customers in specific years, sales in individual states and five clients who contribute to the company's greatest profit. The final project is available in the "Sales Dashboard.xlsx" file.
