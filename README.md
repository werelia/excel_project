## Excel Bike Project

The goal of this project was to improve my skills in organizing and manipulating data, performing calculations and analyses, and creating visual representations of data using graphs and charts. The final results of my work can be found in the "Excel Bike Dataset.xlsx" file in the "Dashboard" tab.

#### Data Cleaning 

I started by gathering a dataset related to bike sales from GitHub. I downloaded the dataset in its raw format. (The raw dataset is in the file "Excel Bike Dataset - Raw.xlsx").

- I started by cleaning up the data by identifying and removing any duplicate entries.

- To make the data more understandable and consistent, I replaced the abbreviations of the variable column names with their corresponding full forms.

- Furthermore, I have organized the age data into meaningful groups for easier visualization. I created a new column using Excel's IF function to divide people into age groups such as "Teen", "Middle Age", and "Old" based on their age values.

#### Data Procesing 

Once the data collection and cleaning phase was complete, I proceeded with data processing in Excel for my project.

- One of the key data processing steps I undertook was creating a pivot table. Using Excel's PivotTable feature, I was able to summarize and aggregate bicycle sales data based on various variables such as sales data, customer demographics, and product details. This enabled easier data analysis and visualization and valuable insights from the bicycle sales dataset.

#### Insights 

The analysis in a dynamic way, depending on selected data filters such as region, marital status or education level, provides information on gender, age group of buyers and purpose of commuting.
